## Overview

Multi Chef has two components: the `multi_chef.rb` Ruby script which sets up the environment a la ChefDK's `chef shell-init` and a knife.rb. The following environment variables are managed by `multi_chef.rb` and consumed by knife.rb:
-   CHEFRC_MODE
-   CHEF_HOST
-   CHEF_REPO
-   CHEF_HOME
-   CHEF_ORG
-   CHEF_USER
-   CHEF_EMAIL

The CHEF_REPO variable is set as a useful shorthand for referencing the current `knife[:chef_repo_path]`. For example, `knife data bag from file foodatabag ${CHEF_REPO}/data_bags/foodatabag`.

__Warning!__ In addition to the above environmental variables, `multi_chef.rb` also writes Berkshelf configuration to `~/.berkshelf/config.json`.

## Getting Started

There are two usage modes for multi_chef: __single__ and __multi__.

### Single user install

Single mode is default and intended for use on non-shared systems (i.e. a personal laptop).

1.  Clone Multi Chef:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jbartko/multi_chef.git ~/multi_chef
    ```

1.  Issue the following eval statement, substituting your own values:

    ```bash
    eval "$(~/multi_chef/multi_chef.rb -a CHEF_HOST -o CHEF_ORG -u CHEF_USER)"
    ```

    This should result in output similar to:

    ```
    Create the directory structure with:
    	mkdir -p ~/multi_chef/{,.chef/}hosts/CHEF_HOST \
    	  ~/multi_chef/hosts/CHEF_HOST/CHEF_ORG/CHEF_USER/cookbooks \
    	  ~/multi_chef/cookbooks

    Then move CHEF_USER's client key to:
    	~/multi_chef/.chef/hosts/CHEF_HOST/CHEF_USER.pem
    ```

1.  _Follow the instructions._  
    With the user client key in the appropriate place, re-issue the same eval statement. Now its output should resemble:
    ```
    CHEF_REPO: ~/multi_chef/hosts/CHEF_HOST/CHEF_ORG/CHEF_USER
    ```

Your shell has been prepared by Multi Chef! Congratulations. It should now be possible to issue knife commands and to use the [`chef-switch`](#chef-switch) function to maneuver between different Chef organizations and API endpoints on the fly.

Optionally, place an eval statement in your ~/.bashrc after the ChefDK shell initialization, e.g.:

```bash
# .bashrc snippet...
eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"
eval "$(~/multi_chef/multi_chef.rb -a DEFAULT_CHEF_HOST -o DEFAULT_CHEF_ORG -u DEFAULT_CHEF_USER)"
# ...
```

### Multi user install

Multi mode is intended to be used on a shared multi-user system such as a Knife SSH gateway or bastion host with ChefDK available. Organizational cookbooks will be shared among users.

1.  Clone Multi Chef into a shared location such as `/usr/local` or `/opt`:

    ```bash
    sudo git clone https://github.com/jbartko/multi_chef.git /opt/multi_chef
    ```

1.  Set ownership and permissions of the hosts directories to a group identifying Chef users:

    ```bash
    sudo chown :chef-users /opt/multi_chef/{cookbooks,hosts}/ /opt/multi_chef/.chef/hosts/
    sudo chmod g+srwx /opt/multi_chef/{.chef/hosts,cookbooks,hosts}/
    ```

1.  If both the host and Chef are authenticating users from the same identity store, an `/etc/profile.d` script can be used to set up the environment for users logging into the host. For example:

    ```bash
    # If not running interactively, don't do anything
    case $- in
      *i*) ;;
        *) return;;
    esac

    # If user belongs to the chef-users group...
    if id | grep -q chef-users; then
      # create a Berkshelf directory
      if ! [ -e ~/.berkshelf ]; then
        mkdir -p ~/.berkshelf
      fi

      # source ChefDK environment
      eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"

      # strip domain, replace dots with underscores
      CHEF_USER=${USER%%@*}
      export CHEF_USER=${CHEF_USER//./_}

      # source Multi Chef
      eval "$(/opt/multi_chef/multi_chef.rb -m multi -a COMPANY_CHEF_HOST -o COMPANY_DEFAULT_CHEF_ORG -u $CHEF_USER)"
    fi

    ```

## `chef-switch`

Evaluating `multi_chef.rb` makes available the `chef-switch` shell function. It can be used as a shorthand to invoke `multi_chef.rb` without calling it by path.

With `chef-switch`, it is possible to easily change between Chef organizations:

```
chef-switch -o OTHER_CHEF_ORG -u CHEF_USER
```

Or between Chef API service endpoints:

```
chef-switch -a OTHER_CHEF_API -o YET_ANOTHER_CHEF_ORG -u DIFFERENT_CHEF_USER
```

### Advanced Usage Scenarios

#### Chef replication substitute

chef-switch can assist in copying assets between Chef servers as a poor man's [Chef server replication](https://docs.chef.io/server_replication.html). For example:

```
chef-switch -o CHEF_ORG -u CHEF_USER
knife download /cookbooks/apt
chef-switch -a OTHER_CHEF_SERVER -o OTHER_CHEF_ORG -u CHEF_USER
knife cookbook upload apt
```

#### Shared organizational Chef repository

To use this repo as a shared, versioned Chef repository, begin by deleting `hosts/.gitignore`, then change the repository remote.

#### Use with existing Chef repositories

It is not necessary to store Chef policy assets alongside multi_chef.rb. The `-c|--chef-home` option can specify a different Chef repository root.

```
chef-switch -c ~/dev-chef -o dev -u CHEF_USER
chef-switch -c ~/prod-chef -o prod -u CHEF_USER
```
